# Conditional Statements -
- A conditional statement in shell scripting allows your script to make decisions based on certain conditions.
- It checks whether a condition is true or false and then executes specific commands accordingly.
# if, elif and else-
- if: Checks the first condition.
- elif: Checks an additional condition if the previous one was false.
- else: Executes if all previous conditions are false.
#### syntax:
  if {condition}
  then
      {execute this}
  else
      {execute this}
  fi
